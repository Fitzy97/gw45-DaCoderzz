Set 10
1. The isValid method is specified in the Grid interface, and is implemented by the BoundedGrid class and the UnboundedGrid class.

2. getValidAdjacentLocations calls the isValid method. The other methods don't have to call isValid because they call getValidAdjacentLocations instead, and use the ArrayList getValidAdjacentLocations returns as they see fit. 

3. getNeighbors calls Grid methods and getOccupiedAdjacentLocations. 

4. The get method can return null, which tests for whether a location is empty or not.

5. There would be less possible valid adjacent locations (just north, south, west, and east).
