Do You Know?
Set 7
1) act, getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, makeMove

2) getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, makeMove

3) Yes, because the subclasses may need to select actors from places other than from the Critter class.

4) A critter can process actors actors by changing their colors.

5) (1) getMoveLocation: returns a list of the empty locations adjacent to the critter (2) selectMoveLocation: randomly chooses and returns one of the adjacent empty locations returned by getMoveLocation (3) makeMove: uses the location returned by selectMoveLocation to move to the new location.

6) Critter extends Actor, which provides a default constructor.
